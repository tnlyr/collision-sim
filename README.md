## Introduction

Physics collisions are fundamental phenomena in the physical world, occurring in everyday situations, from car crashes to billiard balls on a table. The Physics Collision Simulation project aims to provide a platform for understanding and experimenting with these collisions in a virtual environment. It is an educational and illustrative tool designed for physics students, educators, and enthusiasts.

## Features

Our team created a physics collision simulator to help teachers and students visualize
physical principles and gain a deeper understanding of classical mechanics. Our physics
simulation helps explain the different types of collisions in mechanics: elastic and
inelastic. In order to achieve this, our application will depict, through a graphical user
interface, two cars with configurable parameters colliding with one another. This
simulation will accurately represent mechanical principles and exhibit the impact of the
controlled variables. Through our interface, the users access these different variables,
where they can change the weight and the velocity of the car while selecting the
percentage of elasticity and inelasticity of the collision. Plus, they can change the terrain
type to change the coefficient of friction, which will impact the overall simulation.

- **Elastic and Inelastic Collisions:** Simulate both elastic and inelastic collisions to explore how kinetic energy is conserved or lost during interactions between objects.

- **Playback speed:** One of the unique features of our physics collision simulation is the ability to control playback speed. This feature allows users to adjust the pace at which collisions are simulated, providing a more flexible and informative learning experience.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the mass, initial velocity, terrain type, and other properties of objects to observe how different parameters affect collision outcomes.

- **Import/Export Simulations:** Want to show your friends your simulation on their own machine? Sure thing, this program is able to import and export simulations to start where you left from.
